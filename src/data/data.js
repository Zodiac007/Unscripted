But the thing is I need lots of money for that, which I don’t have. So here I am working my ass off hoping to have enough money one day to do just that.I enjoy doing what most people find tedious, boring and unnecessary - planning, budgeting, scheduling, problem solving and generally, just organising shoots. I have a passion for making things happen as envisioned. I shoot, edit and sometimes write as well.",
