            The internet has democratized opinion and we want to democratize
            ‘journalism’.

          <p>
            In this deluge of information, legacy media, and old-world news have
            lost their connection with, and therefore the trust of, the young
            Indian on their mobile handset.
          </p>
          <p>We are young India, and we intend to fix that.</p>
          <p>
            We want to create a space where you can directly engage with the
            creator. The Unscripted community, you, will form the backbone of
            our creative vision where we not only produce stories, information,
            analysis, and reports for a larger audience but through our
            conversations with you, we will produce content that reflects the
            issues you care about.
